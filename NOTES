;; pre/post increment
postincrement has faster pop, preincrement has faster push
push is probably slightly more common because sometimes you drop, rather than popping


;; postincrement
; push
@ &SP     ; A points to SP
AM = M+1  ; inc SP, store, read into A -- A points to slot past target
A = A-1   ; A points to target
M = D     ; write

; pop
@ &SP
AM = M-1
D/A = M

;; preincrement
; push
@ &SP
AM = M+1
M = D

; pop
@ &SP
AM = M-1
A = A+1
D/A = M
